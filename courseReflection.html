	                     Entering this course I had very limited design, HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills. As such I had a massive learning curve, and am very happy to state that I learnt a large amount of many different aspects of interaction design.
                        </p>
                    <P id='hashAbout'>Meeting Expectation</P>
                        <p>
                        Throughout the semester I kept referring back to my <a href="http://davidwjeffs.blogspot.com.au/2016/08/week-1-my-thoughts-on-program-entering.html">week one blog post</a> in attempt to keep my learning on track.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I stated that I wanted to learn about HTML/CSS and Javascript. I was not aware of such frameworks as BootStrap, SASS, jQuery etc and have walked away this semester knowing that I significantly increased my knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        There was one stage early on in semester where I did consider that I had thrown myself in the deep end too much. However by also throwing myself at the programming I also improved my study skills.
                        </p>
                    <P id='hashAbout'>Learning Across the Course</P>
                        <p>
                        As stated above, I have learnt a range of concepts across a range of disciplines. Whilst my design skills still need much work, I do believe study over summer, and  additionally further study next semester will provide the same learning opportunities as this course has.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Whilst the contact sessions were largely useful for providing direction, and ensuring group communication I found the workshops incredibly useful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I attempted to use the workshops to further my knowledge within the field, and set goals for myself both in this semester and later on in my career. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I actually attended both scheduled workshops as I found that Dion and Jacob both had incredible skills in a diverse range of applications. Spending time with both of them has widened my eyes to many possibilities, and further helped me refine the direction I'd like my Masters degree to take me. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The lectures were of immense use. The concepts learnt were very broad, and provided me with plenty of ideas of the direction I would like to take my career.
                        </p>
                        <P id='hashAbout'>Changes to Improve the Course Experience</P>
                        <p>
                        Heading into the project we decided to implement a solution using Google Maps API. In hindsight this was not the best use of our time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It would have been much more useful for our small team to focus on learning valuable skills within PHP/MySQL on top of the JavaScript knowledge. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        However that is great in hindsight. I do think more emphasis could be provided on the necessity to fully research Trove. I found that the ideas produced by most class members to only briefly scrape the surface of what Trove can accomplish. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In terms of my approach to learning. I do feel that spending time working on projects in an even manner throughout semester would benefit me greatly.
