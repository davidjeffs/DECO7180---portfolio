	                     Live My Life is a web application that analyses autobiographies and provides you with photos and newspaper articles about the locations that are mentioned. This provides great insight into the locations and events that formed the life of the books subject.
                        </p>
                        <p>	
	                     This idea is based on the Trove website which is a unique collection of information from across a number of Australian based websites. The design exploration stage involved thorough probing into the information involved within Trove, and ideating creative ways in which potential users can interact with it. 
                        </p>

                    <p>
                     It was suggested by the program co-ordinator to work on an idea that would stimulate us for a semester. Knowing my own enthusiasm from travel, the Trove dataset was ideated from mainly a travel angle. I was aware of many problems existing within the travel sector, and looked to help solve them with Trove.

	                 As mentioned in my <a href="http://davidwjeffs.blogspot.com.au/2016/08/week-1-my-thoughts-on-program-entering.html">initial blog post</a>, I came up with approximately 20 ideas. The ideas were then discussed and iterated upon among a small number of postgraduates. Many ideas were scrapped, however I was able to combine and refine a small number.
                    </p>
                     <p>
	                 The design process of iteration was used continuously over several weeks, with brainstorm sessions, mind maps and viability assessment all being undertaken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                 Thinking outside the box is hard to define. However the exploration of websites both unrelated and related to data representation broadened my horizons. I examined the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/online_projects">New York Public Library Online Projects</a> as well as reading up on the latest technology advances on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>, and also exploring new perspectives on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>.

                    Live My Life aimed to pull digital autobiographies from the Open Library website via Trove. The text would then be analysed and locations pulled.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Google Maps API would then show these locations on a map and provide more information on each, with photos and newspaper articles pulled from Trove.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As the users makes their way through the book, a heat map would be built showcasing locations which featured prominently in the life of the books subject. Users would additionally be able to prepare travel itineraries based around locations of their choosing.

                    <p>
                     On my travels I have noticed that many people tend to read books based upon that location in order to form a greater understanding.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     I myself have also read travel books such as 'On the Road' by Jack Kerouac which describes postwar USA, and creates vivid images in the readers mind. However there are no images or newspaper articles to provide further background on the locations described.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                     Live My Life aimed to grow the experience of reading and provide a more immersive experience.

                        <p>
                        Immersing ones self in new material is always an interesting experience. Trove is vast and as such a full exploration could take months, before the ideation stage is even attempted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The process that I undertook was definitely flawed. While I like to attempt to break the rules, I broke them in a negative way by jumping too quickly from Trove exploration to ideation. Future students should spend much longer than they think exploring Trove. Initially I understood that there are photos and documents, but I failed to fully grasp what the photos represented, and what information the documents contained. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        During the ideation stage I was fully aware that presenting a general travel application would not be original. The brainstorming that I undertook involved attempting to think of ways to use the data which perhaps had not been thought of before. The largest problem with this aspect of the process was limiting myself to the technically feasible. Live My Life as an idea would require powerful algorithms and databases to pull information regarding locations from the text of an autobiography.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Overall I am happy with the solution presented. However I would like to significantly improve my poster. I am a fan of minimalist design, and felt that the poster was too overwhelming with information to be convincing.
