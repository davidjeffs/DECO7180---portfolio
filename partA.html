                        <p>	
                        It is said that the smartest people know they don't know. It is with this philosophy that I formed a team for this project.
                        There were several non-negotiables that I was looking for in a team:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li id="listJustify">Must involve an aspect of travel.</li><br>
                            <li id="listJustify">I must be able to learn about coding.</li><br>
                            <li id="listJustify">The team must be small so as I accelerate learning in all aspects of design (ideal size of 4)</li><br>
                        </ol> 
                        <p>
                        Forming a team with Bastian, Lily and Jie, I was presented with the opportunity to learn from all of their individual skills sets. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Jie, who was slated to be our head designer left early on. However this pushed me to try even harder in the subject and whet my appetite for knowledge.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                
                 <div id="wholeRow">

                    <P id='hashAbout'>Ideation</P>
                    <p>
                    The team formed was focused on the travel aspect of Trove. I attempted to suggest we choose one idea rather than a few, however the group consensus was to merge ideas. Brainstorming together we were able to come up with an idea that potentially satisfied each member.
                     </p>
                     <p>
	                CityWalker was formed after a very short amount of deliberation. In hindsight I would have preferred to have further explored the problem space and presented a more novel idea. While I knew I would learn alot from this course, I was not entirely sold on the bland nature of the overall concept. 
                    </p>
  

                </div>
                    
                <div id="newRow">
                <div id="leftColumn">
                    <P id='hashAbout'>Conceptualisation</P>
                    <p>	In my view CityWalker was formed by presenting ourselves with a problem. How can we show the historical data of Trove on a map in an interesting way? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                With a thorough group discussion we settled on the basic idea of creating routes around cities based upon location information available with Trove. Being in the early stages I suggested we again further look into Trove to see how we could expand upon the concept. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="rightColumn">
                    <P id='hashAbout'>Background Research</P>
                    <p>
                    	The idea refinement came with thorough research into the saturated travel space. Contact with the founder of Brisbane travel StartUp StoryBoard provided great insight to the possibilities of the application. This application put me on the thought process of exploring using journeys. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    I also undertook an examination of the competitors space and came across a Brisbane council run initiative which produces brochures on historical location based routes around local suburbs. This validated our proposal to produce a user curated electronic version of this similar concept. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                </div>
                    
                <div id="newRow">
                <div id="leftColumn">
                    <P id='hashAbout'>Audience Refinement</P>
                    <p>	In addition to research about competitors, I also undertook research into the potential demographics. This helped us ascertain that an audience existed for such a product, and additionally to help us focus on user needs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We developed an online Google consumer survey which allowed us to consider what interests specific age groups are interested in when travelling. In hindsight, this survey needs significant more detail, and less funnelling questions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I additionally performed research on the age demographics of baby boomers in order to determine whether there was a viable need for such an application. My research uncovered a huge growth industry which has been under-developed as most developers focus on the digitally competent youth market. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The user research led us to develop a typical user persona, around which we could base our design decisions. This persona has helped us refine the application throughout all steps in the process.
                    </p>

                    The digital prototype of of this section was largely produced by Lily using the Invision software. However we all inputted ideas into how the website should ideally look.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Similar to Live My Life, I suggested the process of choosing a location, selecting interests and then forming a route from there. I was aware significant work would be required on the interface for selecting a location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The digital prototype also involved me producing a logo that represented the travel concept. The font used was rustic to represent a dirt road, whilst the colors represent the orange of a dirt road, and the blue represents the color of the open sky. Its aim was to impart to users what the application is about in one single glance.

                        As in my initial Live My Life project I felt there were several areas where we would be able to improve. The group was eager to jump in and start working on the project. In hindsight it would be much more effective if were to assess, analyse and iterate on several ideas before commiting to one. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The group chosen was a great mix, however three people did mean our workload was higher than larger groups. And whilst our communication was excellent, a greater flexibility in idea iteration should have been undertaken. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The idea chosen was quite novel in focusing on the older demographics of travellers. However our explanation of the concept did require more work. A simpler explanation also helps with our own goals.
