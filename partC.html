	                     Bringing all the sections together has enabled our team to produce a quality body of work.

                        Whilst much of the final stage of our project involved coding, we also undertook a number of design tasks such as a digital prototyping session.

	                 Similar to the paper prototyping, I also undertook Qualitative interviewing after each demonstration of our product. This allowed me in-depth insight into user needs. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
	                 Our navigational issues were largely solved from previous protyping. However I understood from this session that users required more information. This was information about specific locations, and also information about how to get between locations, and additionally time and duration.

	                     There are a large number of individual coding tasks that contributed to the overall user interaction of our product.

                    As in the CityWalker project plan, users are able to select locations and add them to a list, and then get directions (directions service discussed below)  
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     This required significant thought on many aspects, including the coding, and the user feedback. It was considered that users should be able to edit the list of places, and additionally re-arrange them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The video on the right showcases how a user is provided feedback when they choose a location, and additionally when it is deleted.

                    <p>
                     Part of our initial design was to allow users to find directions between various locations. This is a simple Google query, however implementing it into our design required a lot of research, design and thought.   
                     </p>
                     <p>
                    This directions service was required to work in colloboration with locations choosing.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                     The number of issues to be considered within this section ballooned with each change. As per our qualitative interview I introduced distance and duration information (modals). However the poor user interaction regarding this led to considerable discussion on its inclusion. Considerations have facilitated its inclusion, however there it is still a very rough section of the program.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                     I was also able to introduce a recalculation of the route each time a location was added/changed.

                     CityWalker is a web application heavily reliant on the Google API. Overlayed icons are used to showcase potential locations to see, as well as provide information on what classification of location it is, and additionally provide feedback on which locations have been selected to be seen.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     The first three icons below represent the interests showcased by CityWalker, while the fourth one is the icon shown by an interest selected to be seen. They were produced in Adobe Illustrator.
                     </p>
                    <div>
                    <img src="Images/historical.png" style="height: 2em;">
                    <img src="Images/landmarks.png" style="height: 2em;">

                    <img src="Images/historicalSELECTED.png" style="height: 2em;">
                        
                     <p>
                     In addition to the graphic design of the icons, I was also required to make decisions on the logic regarding the change of the icons. An icon was required to change when the location it represents was added by the user. And should the user change their mind, the icon should revert back to the original icon when the location is deleted.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Ideally these icons would dynamically showcase the position in the proposed route, as well as the interest type. This is consideration for future design however.

	                       Having a set end date for the completion of a project provides significant motivation in completing tasks. The final section of this project involved our team working at seperate times due to academic and extra-curricular clashes.
                        </p>
                        <p>	
	                       Due to the lack of group time to communicate each of worked automonously on sections that we felt were in need of improvement.
                        </p>
                        <p>	
	                       Additionally this section involved many strategic decisions as to the direction of the project. Due to time constraints we were unable to implement the proposed PHP/MySQL database. This is also slated for future enhancements.
